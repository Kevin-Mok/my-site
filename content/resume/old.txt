- Reduced deployment time by **66%** by [implementing ability](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-operator/commit/175a6356c5474f2360ccb8ae835e0b9b2d653cf1) to 
  deploy locally-compiled binaries onto **Kubernetes**/**OpenShift**
  using only command-line (**Kubernetes/GoLang** used for this and three below). 
- Implemented ability for Kubernetes operator to fetch data 
  from a deployed service and update config with data to 
  deprecate reliance on startup script.
- Added startup probes to handle starting legacy application containers that require additional startup time.
- Refactored probes to [have default values](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-operator/commit/af4977af228ec8648be28779259d4552246b656f) assigned based on 
  deployed YAML while also fixing reconciliation issues.
- Rewrote the **Jenkins (Groovy)** [nightly pipeline](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-pipelines/commit/4c83f1aecdea2c1ba2796b79839a90d4083dce88) to run in a GitHub 
  PR using a trigger keyword to test all the team's submitted PR's 
  before merging to the main branch.
- Took on tasks and contributed ideas in **Agile sprint** planning meetings in a team of 12 people.  
- Took initiative to write [file](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-pipelines/commit/4c83f1aecdea2c1ba2796b79839a90d4083dce88#diff-7d2c018dafbccec859077d19bf1ade53ec9c7649f235528ce89f5632b109f7e6) 
  to define the GitHub parameters for the above pipeline so that it 
  can be recreated easily.
- Took initiative to write [documentation](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kie-kogito-operator/blob/1534c03d1d26bec08a16608a775782bf8b305de9/docs/GUIDE_FOR_KOGITO_DEVS.md) on how to get started with the project to onboard new 
  developers and mentored the incoming intern.
